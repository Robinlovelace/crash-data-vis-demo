The goal of crash-data-vis-demo is to demonstrate how to get and visualise data on road traffic casualties and road geometries.

```{r}
# Install the remotes package if not yet installed:
if (!"remotes" %in% installed.packages()) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
```

```{r}
# Check you have the packages installed:
remotes::install_cran(c("tidyverse", "stats19"))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and visualisation
library(stats19) # for getting road casualty data
```
